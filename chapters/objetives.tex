\section{General objective}

The general aim of this project is to develop a super-resolution model capable of improving the spatial resolution of Sentinel-2 images from 10 meters and 20 meters to 2.5 meters using a combination of convolutional neural networks and multispectral data fusion techniques. The goal is to enhance both the spatial detail and spectral consistency of the images to support advanced geospatial analysis.

\section{Specific objectives}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{To explore and implement advanced image fusion techniques:} The aim is to combine multispectral bands from Sentinel-2 and other sources (such as NAIP) to enhance spatial and spectral resolution.
    \item \textbf{To design and develop a deep learning-based super-resolution model:} The focus will be on creating a neural network model capable of processing the multispectral data to produce high-resolution outputs while preserving spectral integrity.
    \item \textbf{To apply the Wald Protocol for validation:} This involves using the Wald Protocol to ensure that the super-resolved images maintain consistency with the original images in terms of spatial and spectral properties.
    \item \textbf{To evaluate the performance of the proposed model:} The objective is to assess the model's performance through qualitative and quantitative metrics, comparing it with existing super-resolution techniques.
